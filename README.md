 ## 1-1. Proposal
 
* ### The tutorial that my project is based on;
Tutorial 3_Business Card;

* ### The changes or improvements that I plan to make;
In the tutorial 3, it just used an image target which was hard for it to interact with the virtual object and generate a complete story.

For my midterm project, I want to create a series imageaTargets which would produce three story linesâ€”
```
- on one hand, the series of images in the real world would form a story line independently;
- on the other hand, the series of virtual objects would form the second story line; 
- finally, the compliance as well as the contrast between the two storylines will form the 
  third story line. 
```
* ### How the changes make the app better in AR;

The story that traditionally stored in a 2d media will gain a form that having multiple dimensions, which will give the story multiple interpretations. 

* ###  A plan: steps or tasks that need to be done to develop the app;

```
- Design the three story lines;
- Design the series of imageTarget;
- Find or model the virtual objects that I need;
- Add scripts to the objects in Unity, to animate it;
- Add sound tracks to augment the visual experience;
- Test it in laptop; 
- Test it in iphone;
- Revise the app;
- Final demo;
```

## 1-2. Briefly explain why did you want to make this project?
  
  To some extents, I truely believe that the behavior, flying, per se can inspire people.
  
  I clearly know that there are many people living in quiet desperation. 
  
  The objectives of all my works till now were the same, which is letting these people finding the faith of life again.
