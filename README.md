 ## 1-1. Proposal
 
* ### The tutorial that my project is based on;
Tutorial 3_Business Card;

* ### The changes or improvements that I plan to make;
In the tutorial 3, it just used an image target which was hard for it to interact with the virtual object and generate a complete story.

For my midterm project, I want to create a series imageaTargets which would produce three story linesâ€”
```
- on one hand, the series of images in the real world would form a story line independently;
- on the other hand, the series of virtual objects would form the second story line; 
- finally, the compliance as well as the contrast between the two storylines will form the 
  third story line. 
```
* ### How the changes make the app better in AR;

The story that traditionally stored in a 2d media will gain a form that having multiple dimensions, which will give the story multiple interpretations. 

* ###  A plan: steps or tasks that need to be done to develop the app;

```
- Design the three story lines;
- Design the series of imageTarget;
- Find or model the virtual objects that I need;
- Add scripts to the objects in Unity, to animate it;
- Add sound tracks to augment the visual experience;
- Test it in laptop; 
- Test it in iphone;
- Revise the app;
- Final demo;
```
